### Github Explorer Ignite 🌐

The Github Explorer is a simple project that aims to demonstrate the basic workings of Webpack, Babel, and React. It will be an application that allows you to search GitHub repositories, displaying information such as name, description, language, and number of stars.

### Technologies 💻

- **Webpack:** A module bundler tool responsible for grouping JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets, creating a single file for the browser.
- **Babel:** JavaScript code transpiler, which converts code written in modern JavaScript (ES6+) to a version compatible with older browsers.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UI).
